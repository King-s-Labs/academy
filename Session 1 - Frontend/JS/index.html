        <h1><span>Maximising Value,</span> Minimising Hassle.</h1>
        <p>The benefit of learning from other students is that we know what it’s like to be in your shoes – what technologies should I learn? What projects should I build? Where should I even begin?</p>
        <p>We've been there.</p>
        <p>We’ve compiled our experiences of university education and navigating early tech careers to produce a course that targets the most valued skills for a student software engineer, delivered in four sessions across six weeks with a final capstone project to showcase your learning.</p>
        <img src="assets/sessions.png" height="200"/>
        <h1><span>Accelerating</span> your career.</h1>
        <p>We’re looking for individuals with a burning passion for tech to join our core Software Engineering Team.</p>
        <p>Impress us in the Academy and gain a fast-track interview for a Software Engineer position at King’s Labs in the following semester.</p>
        <h1>Tailored to <span>you.</span></h1>
        <p>The Academy cohort is purposefully small to ensure each member gains meaningful experience relevant to their own career goals. Upon completion, members receieve a personalised certificate detailing their individual achievements on the course.</p>
